Files Included:
        lab3b.py: Python3 script that iterates through the input CSV file while grabbing data to populate the fields of each defined class (example being the ext2_super class). These fields are then analyzed to discover then report all detected inconsistencies to sys.stdout.

        Makefile: Used to build and run deliverable program. Has 3 options (default, clean, dist). Default erases any old existing symbolic link to lab3b.py then creates a new symbolic link which points to lab3b.py. Clean erases the tarball dist and the symbolic link to lab3b.py. Dist creates a tarball dist to be submitted

        README: Contains additional info about the included files and the sources used for the project.
