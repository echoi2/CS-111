Files and Descriptions:
lab1a.c:
	Contains the source code file used when building the executable via Makefile. The program works by passing input and output between a parent and child process. The different options allowed are --shell and --debug (--debug was however optional so I did not do). By specifying the shell option, you can two inputs between terminal and shell.  

Makefile:
	Used to compile the program by building an executable, make a tarball, and to clean the directory to restore it back to its original state.

README:
	Includes a description of what is actually in the project and some of the sources used.
